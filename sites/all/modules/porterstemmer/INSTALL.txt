For general information about this module, check the README.txt file.

Installation
------------

1. Unzip the files, and upload them as a subdirectory of the
sites/all/modules directory of your Drupal installation (or the
location you normally use for contributed modules).

2. Go to 'Administer > Site building > Modules', and enable the Porter
Stemmer module.

3. Go to 'Administer > Site configuration > Search settings' and click
'Re-index site'.  You should do this step whenever you upgrade to a
new version of the Porter Stemmer module, so that the search index is
rebuilt with any changes to the stemming algorithm.

4. Ensure that cron has run at least once, to build the search
index. On larger sites, it may take several cron runs to complete the
search index. You can check progress on the Search Settings page, and
you can run cron manually by visiting 'Reports > Status report', and
clicking on 'Run cron manually'.
