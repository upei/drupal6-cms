Readme
------

This module implements the Porter-Stemmer algorithm to improve English-language
searching with the Drupal built-in search.module.

It reduces each word in the index to its basic root or stem (e.g. 'blogging' to
'blog') so that variations on a word ('blogs', 'blogger', 'blogging', 'blog') are
considered equivalent when searching. This generally results in more relevant
results.

Installation
------------

1. Copy the porterstemmer.module to the Drupal modules/ directory.

2. Go to 'administer > modules', and enable the porterstemmer.module

3. Go to 'administer > settings > search' and click 'Re-index site'.
