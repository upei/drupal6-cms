Name: TinyMCE module
         
Dependancies:
  This module requires the third-party TinyMCE editor and a
  Javascript-enabled web browser.  Currently it is known to work
  with Internet Explorer, Mozilla and Firefox and degrade gracefully
  for Safari and Konqueror users. A browser compatibility chart is here:

INSTALLATION:
********************************************************************

NOTE: During this installation process you'll be asked to also 
      install the official TinyMCE package from 
      tinymce.moxiecode.com.


1. Place the entire tinymce directory into your Drupal modules/
   directory.

   
2. Download the latest version of TinyMCE from

     http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/

   Remember to uncompress the file and make sure the folder is named
   'tinymce'.

   
3. Place the entire 'tinymce' engine folder inside your modules/tinymce
   directory. So the TinyMCE engine will live in modules/tinymce/tinymce

   
4. Enable this module by navigating to:

     administer > modules
     
     *note - all database tables will be automatically created during this step

     
5. Setup role based tinymce profiles via

     administer > settings > tinymce

     
6. To boost the performance of TinyMCE, download the "TinyMCE compressor" from:

     http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/download.php

   Place the tiny_mce_gzip.js and tiny_mce_gzip.php files in 
   
     modules/tinymce/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce

      
7. To use AJAX spell checking, download the spellchecker plugin:
   (note: this requires TinyMCE 2.0.6+)
   
     http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/download.php
   
   Extract this file to
     
     modules/tinymce/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/
   
   Then edit config.php in plugins/spellchecker/:
   
     Uncomment this line and comment out all other require_once's:
   
       require_once("classes/TinyGoogleSpell.class.php"); // Google web service
   
     Set this to true:	
	 
	     $spellCheckerConfig['enabled'] = true;
	  
	 Enable spellchecker in TinyMCE settings page, under "buttons and plugins"


   
Create new content as a role that has TinyMCE permissions and see TinyMCE in
action!
