Your view must meet the following <strong>requirement</strong>:
<ul>
  <li><strong>"Items to display"</strong> in your basic view settings must be set <strong>higher than the "Items to show"</strong> value in your spy options.</li>
</ul>
<center><em>Example setup:</em>
<a href="path:images/views-bonus-spy-config.png"><img src="path:images/views-bonus-spy-config.png" style="width: 400px;"/></a></center>
Choose Views Spy in the Style dialog within your view, which will prompt you to configure:
<ul>
  <li><strong>Items to show:</strong> How many items to show all the time. Must be lower than the items being shown by the view.</li>
  <li><strong>Transition time:</strong> The time in seconds to wait before switching the next item in. Note that this will be added to Fading speed and Sliding speed for the total value that will be used.</li>
  <li><strong>Fading speed:</strong> The time in seconds for the fading in and out of the elements.</li>
  <li><strong>Sliding speed:</strong> The time in seconds for the sliding down of the elements.</li>
  <li><strong>Pause on mouse over:</strong> Whether or not the Spy should pause when the user's mouse hovers the section.</li>

</ul>
