Views Spy is a module that provides a <a href="topic:views/style">display style</a> plugin for the <a href="topic:views/about">Views</a> module.
It will take the results and display them as a JQuery Spy (similar to the <a href="http://digg.com/spy">Digg spy</a>).
The jQuery was originaly based on the tutorial by <a href="http://jqueryfordesigners.com/simple-jquery-spy-effect/">jqueryfordesigners.com</a>, then expanded and implemented to work with <a href="topic:views/about">Views</a>.
