This module comes with a default css stylesheet, which you can disable in the options. Files included for your convinence:
<ul>
<li><strong>views-bonus-spy.css</strong> - A default stylesheet.
<strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> The js will figure out the height of the first item shown, and set that height to all other items in the spy. This is the default behaviour, so if this causes problems, be sure to set an appropiate height to div.views-spy-item so that all fit in, and the js will use that height instead.
Having margins/paddings on top/bottom on elements within .views-spy-item can cause problems. Use the .views.spy-item height property to fix these.
</li>
<li><strong>views-bonus-spy.tpl.php</strong> - copy/paste into your theme directory - please the comments in this file for requirements/instructions.</li>
</ul>
Both files are commented to explain how things work. Do read them to avoid headaches.
