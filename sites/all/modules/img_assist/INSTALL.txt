* TinyMCE module (optional) <http://drupal.org/project/tinymce>


-- PRE-REQUISITES --

* If you are upgrading from a previous version, please

  - follow the compatibility note on http://drupal.org/project/img_assist

  - backup your files and database in front of the upgrade

  - run Drupal's update.php after updating the module's files.
    Further information: http://drupal.org/upgrade/running-update-php

  - read notes about important changes that may affect your site or theme in
    CHANGELOG.txt.

  - update your theme, especially if you have any theme override functions for
    image or img_assist.


-- INSTALLATION --

* Place the entire img_assist directory into a modules directory of your
  choice, in most cases: sites/all/modules.

* Enable the Image Assist module by navigating to:

  Administer > Site building > Modules

* Configure an input format and enable the filter 'Inline images' by visiting:

  Administer > Site configuration > Input formats

  If you want to enable Inline images for the input format 'Filtered HTML',
  you additionally need to click the 'Configure' tab and add

  <span> <img>

  to the text field 'Allowed HTML tags'.

* Set permissions for using Image Assist by going to:

  Administer > User management > Access control

* Optionally fine tune how Image Assist operates by navigating to:

  Administer > Site configuration > Image assist

  If Taxonomy module is enabled, you use a gallery module like Acidfree, and you
  want your users to be able to easily choose images from their galleries, select
  for example "Acidfree albums" as the vocabulary to use for Image assist.


-- TINYMCE PLUGIN INSTALLATION --

If you use the TinyMCE WYSIWYG editor, you need to install a plugin for Image
Assist.

* Move or copy the folder 'drupalimage' in the img_assist directory to

  [sites/all/]modules/tinymce/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/
   
  Edit the file plugin_reg.php in the tinymce directory. It's located in:

  [sites/all/]modules/tinymce/plugin_reg.php

  Add the following lines anywhere above the 'return' statement (without the
  <code> tags):
<code>
  $plugins['drupalimage'] = array();
  $plugins['drupalimage']['theme_advanced_buttons1'] = array('drupalimage');
  $plugins['drupalimage']['extended_valid_elements'] = array('img[class|src|border=0|alt|title|width|height|align|name|style]');
</code>

  Next, go to

  Administer > Site configuration > TinyMCE

  and enable the drupalimage plugin in your TinyMCE profile.
