If you are updating your fonrt_Page.module from an earlier version make sure
you copy your existing front page text areas for anonymous users and
authenticated users prior to updating the module.

There are changes in the new version of the module that requires you to
setup your front_page settings again.

1. Go to ADMINISTER -> SETTINGS -> FRONT PAGE
2. Copy your text area settings for anonymous & authenticated users into a text editor
3. Upload the new version of the front_page.module
4. Refresh the settings page
5. Paste your text area settings for anonymous & authenticated users  into the appropriate text areas.
6. Save Configuration.
