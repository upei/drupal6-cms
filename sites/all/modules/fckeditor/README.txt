Overview
--------
This module allows Drupal to replace textarea fields with the
FCKeditor.
This HTML text editor brings many of the powerful functions of known
desktop editors like Word to the web. It's relatively lightweight and
doesn't require any kind of installation on the client computer.

Required components
-------------------
To use FCKeditor in Drupal, you will need to download the FCKeditor
http://www.fckeditor.net/

More information and licence

Requirements
------------
  - Drupal 6.x
  - PHP 4.3.0 or greater
  - FCKeditor 2.5.x or greater (http://www.fckeditor.net/)

Configuration
-------------------
Note: this instruction assumes that you install FCKeditor in
      sites/all/modules directory (recommended).

   1. Unzip the files in the sites/all/modules directory. It should now
      contain a fckeditor directory.
   2. Download FCKeditor from http://www.fckeditor.net/download. Unzip the
      contents of the fckeditor directory in the
      sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor directory.
   3. Enable the module as usual from Drupal's admin pages.
   4. Grant permissions for use of FCKeditor in
      "Administer > User Management > Permissions"
      Note: to enable the file browser, read also the
            "How to enable the file browser" section.
   5. Under "Administer > Site configuration > FCKeditor", adjust
      the fckeditor profiles. In each profile you can choose which textareas
      will be replaced by FCKeditor, select default toolbar and configure
      some more advanced settings.
   6. For the Rich Text Editing to work you also need to configure your filters
      for the users that may access Rich Text Editing.
      Either grant those users Full HTML access or use the following tags:
      <a> <p> <span> <div> <h1> <h2> <h3> <h4> <h5> <h6> <img> <map> <area> <hr>
      <br> <br /> <ul> <ol> <li> <dl> <dt> <dd> <table> <tr> <td> <em> <b> <u> <i> <strong>
      <font> <del> <ins> <sub> <sup> <quote> <blockquote> <pre> <address> <code>
      <cite> <embed> <object> <param> <strike> <caption>.
   7. To have a better control over line breaks, you may disable Line break converter
      in the chosen filter (recommended).
   8. Modify the fckeditor.config.js file to custom your needs (optional).
      You may copy the needed configuration lines from the default FCKeditor
      configuration settings (sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/fckconfig.js),
      the lines in fckeditor.config.js will override most settings.
      In fckeditor.config.js you may define your own toolbars with selected buttons.
      WARNING: clear browser's cache after you modify any of the javascript files.
      If you don't do this, you may notice that browser is ignoring all your changes.


Installation troubleshooting
----------------------------
If your FCKeditor does not show you must check if all files are
extracted correctly.
The directory sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/ should have the
following files:
   - fckeditor.js
   - fckconfig.js
   - fckstyles.xml
   - fcktemplates.xml
and a directory named editor.

The correct directory structure is as follows:
    modules
       fckeditor
          fckeditor.module
          fckeditor
             _samples
             editor
             COPY_HERE.txt
             fckconfig.js
             ...

If you're still having problems, scroll down to the "Help & Contribution" section.

Plugins: Teaser break and Pagebreak
-----------------------------------
By default, FCKeditor module comes with two plugins that can handle
teaser break (<!--break-->) and pagebreak (<!--pagebreak-->).
You can enable any (or even both) of them.

   1. Open sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor.config.js and
      uncomment these three lines:

            FCKConfig.PluginsPath = '../../plugins/' ;
            FCKConfig.Plugins.Add( 'drupalbreak' ) ;
            FCKConfig.Plugins.Add( 'drupalpagebreak' ) ;


   2. The second step is to add buttons to the toolbar (in the same file).
      The button names are: DrupalBreak, DrupalPageBreak.
      For example if you have a toolbar with an array of buttons defined
      as follows:

      ['Image','Flash','Table','Rule','SpecialChar']

      simply add those two buttons at the end of array:

      ['Image','Flash','Table','Rule','SpecialChar', 'DrupalBreak', 'DrupalPageBreak']

      (remember about single quotes).

Uploading images and files
--------------------------

There are three ways of uploading files: By using the built-in file browser,
by using a module like IMCE or using the core upload module.

How to enable the built-in file browser
------------------------------
The editor gives the end user the flexibility to create a custom file browser
that can be integrated on it.
The included file browser allows users to view the content of a specific
directory on the server and add new content to that directory
(create folders and upload files).

   1. To enable file browsing you need to edit the connector configuration file
      in your fckeditor module directory, the file should be in:

          sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/filemanager/connectors/php/config.php

      In this file(s) you will need to enable the file browser by adding one
      line that includes file with the special authentication function for
      Drupal (filemanager.config.php). Add this code:

          require_once '../../../../../filemanager.config.php';

      straight below this line:

          $Config['UserFilesAbsolutePath'] = '' ;

      The config.php file also holds some other important settings, please
      take a look at it and adjust it to your needs (optional).

   2. Locate file named settings.php inside your drupal directory
      (usually sites/default/settings.php) and set $cookie_domain variable to the
      appropiate domain (remember to uncomment that line). If you not do this,
      FCKeditor will claim that file browser is disabled

   3. Enabling file uploads is a security risk. That's why you have to grant a
      separate permission to enable the file browser to certain groups.
      In "Administer > User Management > Permissions" assign the
      "allow fckeditor file uploads" permissions.

   4. Lastly, adjust the File browser settings for each profile: set "File browser type" to "Built-in filebrowser".

Modules: Image Assist
---------------------
Image Assist can be integrated with FCKeditor.
To do this, simply copy the modules/fckeditor/img_assist_fckeditor.js file to modules/img_assist/img_assist_fckeditor.js.

Upgrading instructions
----------------------
This instruction assumes that you are upgrading FCKeditor module [M] and FCKeditor (the editor)[E] at the same time. 
Instructions specific for module upgrades are tagged with [M], steps that must be taken when upgrading FCKeditor (the editor) are marked with [E].

   1. [M] Download the latest version of FCKeditor module from http://drupal.org/project/fckeditor (it is advised to read release notes before going further).
   2. [E] Download the latest version of FCKeditor from http://www.fckeditor.net/download (it is advised to read "what's new" before going further: http://www.fckeditor.net/whatsnew).
   3. [M] Back up your database.
   4. [EM] Place the site in "Off-line" mode, to let the database updates run without interruption and avoid displaying errors to end users of the site.
   5. [E] If you have used the FCKeditor built-in file browser, make a backup of sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/filemanager/connectors/php/config.php
   6. [E] If you have configured spellchecker, make a backup of sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/editor/dialog/fck_spellerpages/spellerpages/server-scripts/spellchecker.php
   7. [E] If you have made any changes inside of sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor.config.js (or sites/all/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor/fckconfig.js), write down your changes and add them again after uploading new files (e.g. own toolbar definitions, re-enable a plugin etc.). Try to not make any changes to fckconfig.js and add everything to fckeditor.config.js.
   8. Delete old files:
      [EM]* Simply remove modules/fckeditor directory if upgrading both, the editor and the module. 
      [M] If you are upgrading module only, remember to leave the modules/fckeditor/fckeditor directory. 
      [E] When upgrading the editor, remove contents of modules/fckeditor/fckeditor directory only.
      WARNING: if you don't remove old files and just rename fckeditor directory instead e.g. to fckeditor_old, Drupal may use module from the fckeditor_old directory.
   9. [M] Upload FCKeditor module (extracted files and folders) to sites/all/modules directory.
   10. [E] Upload FCKeditor (extracted files and folders from the fckeditor directory) to sites/modules/fckeditor/fckeditor (i.e. where COPY HERE.txt file exists)
   11. [E] Replace the new config.php (see step 5) file with the old one (or RECOMMENDED way: perform again step with adding require_once '../../../../../filemanager.config.php'; to config.php)
   12. [E] Replace the new spellchecker.php with the old one (see step 6) (or RECOMMENDED way: configure new spellchecker.php following the settings from the old file).
   13. [E] Apply your modifications to default configuration in fckeditor.config.js file (see step 7).
   14. [M] If you're using Image Assist module, copy the new img_assist_fckeditor.js to modules/img_assist folder.
   15. [M] Run update.php.
   16. [EM] Put the site back online.
